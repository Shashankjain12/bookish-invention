This project involves one of the research work of creating a project that deals with the creation of visually interactive graphs when we pass that module any kind of notebook of any kind of image file you just need to specify the type of image you need to pass on to that document and it will do all the hard work for you by itself by creating of certain nodes with the help of one of the most advanced library of python for desktop creation using tkinter

This project uses the help of certain great libraries of python:-
* Tkinter
* Pillow
* NLTK
* Pytesseract
* re
* numpy
* WordNetLemmatizer
* stopwords
* PypDF2
